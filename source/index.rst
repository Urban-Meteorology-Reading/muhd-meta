Welcome to the metadata site for MUHD (Multi-City Urban Hydrometeorology Database).
MUHD is a collection of urban hydrometeorological observation :ref:`networks<network_def>` around the globe, 
ranging over more than 30 years. Each observation network contains one or more observation :ref:`site<site_def>`. 
Each site has or has had hydrometeorological observation :ref:`instruments<instrument_def>` 
:ref:`deployed<deployement_def>` there. This site contains only information on the metadata of the observation 
networks, sites and instruments, the observation data itself is stored on `Zenodo <https://zenodo.org/>`_.
MUDH is currently administered by the `Urban Micromet Group <http://micromet.reading.ac.uk/>`_ at the University of Reading, UK.
