The BLS 900 is a large aperture scintillometer, manufactured by Scintec. A scintillometer measures turbulence over a path, which can then be used to calculate heat flux, cross wind and evapotranspiration. The BLS 900 consists of two main parts for observations: a transmitter and a receiver. These are placed between 250m and 6000m apart. The transmitter transmits visible light towards thereceiver, which uses the principle of modulation of light by atmospheric refractive index fluctuations in air, known as scintillation, to determine atmospheric turbulence over the path. The main benefit of scintillometry is the greater spatial representation achieved compared to point sensors.
