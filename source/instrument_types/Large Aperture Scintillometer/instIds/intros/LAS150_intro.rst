The LAS 150 is a large aperture scintillometer, manufactured by Kipp and Zonen. A scintillometer measures turbulence over a path, which can then be used to calculate heat flux, cross wind and evapotranspiration. The LAS 150 consists of two main parts for observations: a transmitter and a receiver. These are placed between 100m and 4500m apart. The transmitter transmits visible light towards the receiver, which uses the principle of modulation of light by atmospheric refractive index fluctuations in air, known as scintillation, to determine atmospheric turbulence over the path. The main benefit of scintillometry is the greater spatial representation achieved compared to point sensors. The 150 is an older version of the :ref:`LASMKII`.
