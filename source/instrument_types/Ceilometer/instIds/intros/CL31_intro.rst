The CL31 is a ceilometer manufactured by Vaisala. They measure the atmospheric backscatter and can determine cloud heights for multiple layers. Ceilometers work with an invisible eye safe laser that shoots directly upwards into the air. The CL31 is a newer version than the :ref:`CT25K` and gives slightly better results.
